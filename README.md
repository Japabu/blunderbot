# ðŸŽº BlunderBot: The Chess Shame Machine

*Because every chess blunder deserves a wet fart sound effect*

## What is this monstrosity?

BlunderBot is a Discord bot that watches your Lichess games and provides **completely unnecessary** audio commentary on your chess moves. Think of it as that friend who laughs at your mistakes, except it's a robot and it never gets tired of your pain.

## Features That Nobody Asked For

- ðŸŽµ **Real-time move analysis**: Uses Stockfish to judge your every decision
- ðŸ”Š **Premium sound effects**: From wet farts for blunders to airhorns for brilliant moves
- ðŸ‘€ **Stalker mode**: Watches your games like a chess-obsessed helicopter parent
- ðŸ¤– **Discord integration**: Because shame is better when shared with friends

## Sound Effect Tier List

### When You Make a Good Move (+50 to +300 centipawns):
- ðŸ“¯ **Airhorn** (+300): For when you accidentally play like Magnus
- ðŸ’° **Price is Right** (+150): *Come on down!* You're the next contestant on "Not Terrible at Chess!"

### When You Blunder (-50 to -300 centipawns):
- ðŸŽ® **Minecraft Damage** (-50): *Oof* but pixelated
- ðŸ˜¤ **Bruh** (-100): The universal sound of disappointment
- ðŸ¤• **Roblox Oof** (-150): Death sound for your position
- ðŸ’¨ **Wet Fart** (-300): For when you really, *really* messed up

## Setup (If You Dare)

1. **Prerequisites**: 
   - Node.js (because JavaScript is the only language that makes sense for chaos)
   - A Discord bot token (steal one from Discord's cookie jar)
   - A Stockfish server (or use someone else's, we won't tell)
   - The ability to handle public humiliation

2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # Install your shame
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Copy your Discord bot token to `.env` (it's already there, you're welcome)
   - Set up your `STOCKFISH_SERVER_URL` because we're too lazy to run Stockfish locally
   - Invite the bot to your server and give it voice channel permissions

4. **Run the shame machine**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Let the roasting begin
   ```

## Commands

- `/lichess <username>` - Start stalking a Lichess player (with their consent, hopefully)
- `/stop` - Stop the madness (coward)
- `/ping` - Check if the bot is alive and ready to judge you

## How It Works (The Magic Behind the Misery)

1. **Stalking Phase**: Bot polls Lichess API every 3 seconds to see if you're playing
2. **Connection Phase**: Opens WebSocket to your game like a chess paparazzi
3. **Analysis Phase**: Feeds your moves to Stockfish for professional judgment
4. **Shame Phase**: Calculates move quality and plays appropriate sound effect
5. **Repeat**: Until you rage quit or achieve chess enlightenment

## Technical Details (For the Nerds)

- Built with Discord.js because we hate ourselves
- Uses Lichess WebSocket API for real-time game data
- Stockfish evaluation via HTTP API (because running engines is hard)
- Audio playback through Discord voice channels
- Dockerized for easy deployment to the cloud of shame

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add more humiliating sound effects? PRs welcome! Just remember:
- Keep it family-friendly (ish)
- Test your changes (unlike your chess moves)
- Add more sound effects for different centipawn ranges
- Make the bot even more judgmental

## Disclaimer

- Hurt feelings
- Improved chess play (through fear)
- Uncontrollable laughter from your Discord friends
- Existential crisis about your chess abilities
- Addiction to the sweet sound of airhorns
